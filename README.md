## Assignment 1 insights and summaries:

Significant evidence to suggest relationship between spending and loyalty (p<0.05), CI did not have 0.
R-Squared tells us relationship between spending and loyalty explains 45.2% of the variance.
The coefficient value of 33.0617 tells us that as spending_score increases by 1, the predicted value of loyalty_points increases by 33.0617.

Significant evidence to suggest relationship between remuneration and loyalty (p<0.05), CI did not have 0.
R-Squared tells us relationship between spending and loyalty explains 38.0% of the variance.
The coefficient value of 33.0617 tells us that as remuneration increases by 1, the predicted value of loyalty_points increases by 34.1878.

Insignificant evidence to suggest relationship between age and loyalty (p>0.05), CI had 0.

*Created Multiple Regression model with spending_score and remuneration using MLR:*\
Significant evidence to suggest relationship between remuneration and loyalty (p<0.05), CI did not have 0.
R-Squared tells us that the MLR model of multiple regression explains 82.3% of the variance.
There is insignificant evidence to suggest multicollinearity
